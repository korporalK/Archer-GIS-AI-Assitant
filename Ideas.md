# Enhancements and Features for GIS AI Assistant

---

These are some ideas that I have for Archer at the moment, some of them may have already been implemented. 

## 1. User Interface (UI) Enhancements

### 1.1 Interactive User Interface
- Develop a UI that allows users to interact seamlessly with the system.
- Ensure clear navigation with an intuitive design that improves accessibility.
- Provide real-time feedback and status updates on task execution.

### 1.2 Workspace Selection
- Allow users to select or input their workspace directly from the GUI.
- The workspace should support geodatabases as the primary format.
- Enable quick switching between different workspaces without restarting the application.

### 1.3 API Key Management
- Provide a dedicated setup page in the GUI for users to input API keys.
- Ensure secure storage of API keys with encryption.
- Implement a one-time setup for API keys to streamline future interactions.

### 1.4 Credits and Information Page
- Add a section to display application credits, developer information, and version history.
- Include a brief introduction to the tool and its functionalities.

### 1.5 Text Formatting and UI Improvements
- Improve text padding and spacing in the UI for better readability.
- Use a consistent font and color scheme to enhance visual appeal.

## 2. Memory and Context Management

### 2.1 Project-Based Memory
- Implement a memory system that retains project-specific context.
- Develop an agent that summarizes previous discussions to be passed along with new queries.
- Store important portions of queries and append them to future requests.

### 2.2 Optimized Memory Utilization
- Minimize token usage to improve efficiency and reduce hallucinations.
- Develop a lightweight memory system that prioritizes relevant context retention.
- Implement garbage collection mechanisms to discard unnecessary context.

### 2.3 Custom Memory Storage
- Store only user queries and AI outputs, excluding system prompts and tool definitions.
- Maintain workspace-related memory separately for better organization.
- Optimize retrieval mechanisms to ensure the right context is used for each query.

## 3. Workspace Knowledge Integration

### 3.1 Planner and Verifier Workspace Awareness
- Equip planner and verifier agents with workspace knowledge.
- Enable users to define additional file locations that should be remembered by agents.
- Ensure agents can access relevant spatial datasets dynamically.

### 3.2 Data Description Generation
- Provide an option to manually input dataset descriptions.
- Develop an AI agent that can analyze and generate metadata for new data folders or files.
- Enable structured metadata storage for improved dataset management.

## 4. Tool Integration and Expansion

### 4.1 Additional Geospatial Tools
- Integrate support for Digital Elevation Model (DEM) APIs.
- Enable OpenStreetMap (OSM) data retrieval and processing.
- Expand geospatial analytical tools available within the framework.

---

## 5. Logging and Documentation

### 5.1 Comprehensive JSON Logging
- Implement a structured logging system that captures:
  - User queries
  - Planner, verifier, and executor agent responses
- Format logs in a JSON structure with relevant keys.
- Exclude tool definitions from logs to keep entries concise.

### 5.2 Detailed Documentation
- Write a thorough README detailing:
  - Installation steps
  - Usage instructions
  - Feature descriptions
  - API integration guide
- Include troubleshooting tips and best practices for efficiency.

## 6. User Feedback and Testing

### 6.1 Community Testing and Surveys
- Open beta testing for users to try out the tool.
- Create surveys to gather feedback on usability and performance.
- Iterate based on user insights to enhance the tool further.

---

## 7. AI Agents for Enhanced Functionality

### 7.1 Research Agent
- Develop an agent that conducts internet research based on user queries.
- Summarize relevant information and pass it to the planner agent.
- Improve decision-making for complex GIS-related tasks.

### 7.2 Data Analysis Agent
- Implement an AI-powered agent that performs statistical analysis on datasets.
- Generate detailed reports describing key patterns and insights in the data.

### 7.3 Consultant Agent
- Introduce an interactive consultant agent to better understand user objectives.
- Engage in conversations to clarify goals before passing refined context to planner-verifier-executor agents.
- Allow users to terminate the consultation when they feel their requirements are fully understood.

---

## 8. Performance and Efficiency Improvements

### 8.1 Token Usage Optimization
- Implement efficient memory management to minimize unnecessary token consumption.
- Optimize the agentâ€™s context retention strategy for long queries.
- Develop a lightweight memory model that only retains essential user-AI interactions.
